# 🎯 CALENDAR AND JOBS PAGE IMPROVEMENTS

## ✅ What Was Improved

### 1. **Calendar Page - Now Uses Real Data** 📅

**Before**:
- ❌ Mock data with "John Doe" repeated interviews
- ❌ Edit/Delete buttons didn't work
- ❌ Events hardcoded in component

**After**:
- ✅ Fetches real events from `/access/calendar/` API
- ✅ Edit button opens modal to update event
- ✅ Delete button removes event with confirmation
- ✅ Shows real candidate names from database
- ✅ Loading state while fetching
- ✅ Empty state when no events
- ✅ Auto-refreshes after create/edit/delete

**Features Added**:
```typescript
// Fetch events from backend
fetchEvents() - Gets events for current month
handleScheduleInterview() - Creates new event via API
handleEditEvent() - Opens edit modal
handleUpdateEvent() - Updates event via API
handleDeleteEvent() - Deletes event with confirmation
```

**API Integration**:
- `GET /access/calendar/` - List all events
- `POST /access/calendar/` - Create event
- `PUT /access/calendar/{id}/` - Update event
- `DELETE /access/calendar/{id}/` - Delete event

---

### 2. **Jobs Page - Role-Based UI** 💼

**Before**:
- ❌ Everyone saw same interface
- ❌ Job seekers could see "Add Job" button
- ❌ Recruiters had same view as job seekers

**After**:
- ✅ **For Recruiters**:
  - See "Post New Job" button
  - See "View Applications" button on each job
  - No "Apply Now" button (they can't apply)
  
- ✅ **For Job Seekers**:
  - NO "Post New Job" button (they can't post)
  - See "Apply Now" button on each job
  - Can browse and apply for jobs

**Logic**:
```typescript
const isRecruiter = user?.role === 'recruiter';

// Show different buttons based on role
{isRecruiter && <PostJobButton />}
{!isRecruiter && <ApplyButton />}
```

---

### 3. **Dashboard/Overview - Role-Based Views** 🏠

**Before**:
- ❌ Same dashboard for everyone
- ❌ Job seekers saw recruiter statistics
- ❌ "Add Job" button for job seekers

**After**:
- ✅ **For Recruiters**:
  - Statistics dashboard (interviews, pending, etc.)
  - "Post New Job" button
  - Professional metrics
  
- ✅ **For Job Seekers**:
  - Clean job browsing interface
  - "Browse All Jobs" button
  - "My Applications" button
  - Call-to-action to find jobs

**Experience**:
- Job Seekers see: "Find Your Dream Job" interface
- Recruiters see: Statistical overview dashboard

## 🔄 How It Works Now

6. User clicks "Delete" → Confirmation → API call → Refresh
```

### Jobs Page Workflow:

1. User opens Jobs page
2. System checks user role (recruiter or job_seeker)
3. IF recruiter:

   - Show "View Applications" for each job
4. IF job seeker:
   - Hide post button
   - Show "Apply Now" for each job
```

### Dashboard Workflow:
```
1. User logs in and lands on dashboard
2. System checks user role
3. IF recruiter:
